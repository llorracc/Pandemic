  volume =        {2},

  abstract =      {The goal of this chapter is to study how, and by how
                   much, household income, wealth, and preference
                   heterogeneity amplify and propagate a macroeconomic
                   shock. We focus on the U.S. Great Recession of
                   2007-2009 and proceed in two steps. First, using data
                   from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we document
                   the patterns of household income, consumption and
                   wealth inequality before and during the Great
                   Recession. We then investigate how households in
                   different segments of the wealth distribution were
                   affected by income declines, and how they changed
                   their expenditures differentially during the
                   aggregate downturn. Motivated by this evidence, we
                   study several variants of a standard heterogeneous
                   household model with aggregate shocks and an
                   endogenous cross-sectional wealth distribution. Our
                   key finding is that wealth inequality can
                   significantly amplify the impact of an aggregate
                   shock, and it does so if the distribution features a
                   sufficiently large fraction of households with very
                   little net worth that sharply increase their saving
                   (i.e. they are not hand-to mouth) as the recession
                   hits. We document that both these features are
                   observed in the PSID. We also investigate the role
                   that social insurance policies, such as unemployment
                   insurance, play in shaping the cross-sectional income
                   and wealth distribution, and through it, the dynamics
                   of business cycles.},

  abstract =      {Policymakers, faced with different options for
                   replacing lost earnings, have had limited evidence to
                   inform their decisions. The current economic crisis
                   has highlighted the need for data that are local and
                   timely so that different fiscal policy options on
                   local economies can be more immediately evaluated.
                   This paper provides a framework for evaluating
                   real-time effects of fiscal policy on local economic
                   activity using two new sources of near real-time
                   data. The first data source is administrative records
                   that provide universal, weekly, information on
                   unemployment claimants. The second data source is
                   transaction level data on economic activity that are
                   available on a daily basis. We use shift-share
                   approaches, combined with these two data sources and
                   the novel cross-county variation in the incidence of
                   the COVID-19 supplement to Unemployment Insurance to
                   estimate the local impact of unemployment, earnings
                   replacement, and their interaction on economic
                   activity. We find that higher replacement rates lead
                   to significantly more consumer spending – even with
                   increases in the unemployment rate – consistent
                   with the goal of the fiscal stimulus. Our estimates
                   suggest that, based on the latest data, eliminating
                   the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC)
                   supplement would lead to a 44% decline in local
                   spending. If the FPUC supplement is reduced to $200,
                   resulting in a reduction of the replacement rate by
                   44%, spending would fall by 28%. Even if the FPUC
                   supplement is reduced to $400, the replacement rate
                   would fall by 29% and spending would fall by 12%.
                   Because these data are available in every state, the
                   approach can be used to inform decision making not
                   just in this current crisis, but also in future
                   recessions.},

  abstract =      {Using a large-scale survey of U.S. consumers, we
                   study how the large one-time transfers to individuals
                   from the CARES Act affected their consumption, saving
                   and labor-supply decisions. Most respondents report
                   that they primarily saved or paid down debts with
                   their transfers, with only about 15 percent reporting
                   that they mostly spent it. When providing a detailed
                   breakdown of how they used their checks, individuals
                   report having spent or planning to spend only around
                   40 percent of the total transfer on average. This
                   relatively low rate of spending out of a one-time
                   transfer is higher for those facing liquidity
                   constraints, who are out of the labor force, who live
                   in larger households, who are less educated and those
                   who received smaller amounts. We find no meaningful
                   effect on labor-supply decisions from these transfer
                   payments, except for twenty percent of the unemployed
                   who report that the stimulus payment made them search
                   harder for a job.},

                   “habits” to explain the substantial persistence
                   of aggregate consumption growth. But a large
                   literature has found no evidence of habits in
                   microeconomic datasets that measure the behavior of
                   individual households. We show that the apparent
                   conflict can be explained by a model in which
                   consumers have accurate knowledge of their personal
                   circumstances but ‘sticky expectations’ about the
                   macroeconomy. In our model, the persistence of
                   aggregate consumption growth reflects consumers’
                   imperfect attention to aggregate shocks. Our proposed
                   degree of (macro) inattention has negligible utility
                   costs, because aggregate shocks constitute only a
                   tiny proportion of the uncertainty that consumers
                   face.},
